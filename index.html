<h1 class="FirstProject">First Project</h1>
<p class="FirstProjectPara">This was my very first project. In this project I linked all of the lists to wiki.It also opens a new page to the wiki so it doesnt close out of the website. It makes it easier to view all of the Wikipedias.I also styled with CSS and made the picture the background that went with the marvel theme.It was the first project so it was a very basic website.</p>

<h1 class="multiPage">Multi-Page Business Site</h1>
<p class="multiPagePara">In this project I made a website that has 2 pages.I styled it with CSS and made it fully functional where you can click on the about page and it will take you to the about page. I also added a footer for contact and the career that doesnt have anything in it.This was just to see how to make a business website and how it works. This was my second project. </p>
