</div>
​
<p id="paragraph">I grew up in Glasgow, Kentucky where I was born and raised, I am 25 years old. I am enrolled in a web development class called BC Skills. In 5 years I would like to have my own website and run my own business. I enjoy web development and could see this being a long term career for me. Outside of the class I like to fish, hunt, golf or do anything outdoors. Below I have some projects starting with my first project all the way to the most recent project we have done. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.</p>

    <h1 class="FirstProject">First Project</h1>
    <p class="FirstProjectPara">This was my very first project. In this project I linked all of the lists to wiki.It also opens a new page to the wiki so it doesnt close out of the website. It makes it easier to view all of the Wikipedias.I also styled with CSS and made the picture the background that went with the marvel theme.It was the first project so it was a very basic website.</p>
    <img class="picture2" src="pictures/Multi-Page1.png">
    <img class="picture3" src="pictures/Multi-Page2.png">
    <h1 class="multiPage">Multi-Page Business Site</h1>
    <p class="multiPagePara">In this project I made a website that has 2 pages.I styled it with CSS and made it fully functional where you can click on the about page and it will take you to the about page. I also added a footer for contact and the career that doesnt have anything in it.This was just to see how to make a business website and how it works. This was my second project. </p>
    <img class="picture4" src="pictures/Resource Page .png">
    <h1 class="resourcePage">Resource-Table-Site</h1>
    <p class="resourcePagePara">In this project I made a table for some of the resources that a web developer might need. It is a very basic site but it uses a table that seperates everything out and makes it look nice.This was my third project.</p>
    <img class="picture5" src="pictures/JavaScript Clock.png">
    <h1 class="javaScriptClock">JavaScript Clock</h1>
    <p class="javaScriptClockPara">In this project I made a fully function clock with JavaScript. It was styled with CSS and has very little html in in it. I also made a header that linked my GitHub account along with my LinkedIn account.This was my fourth project.It will update when you refresh the page or log off and back in. </p>
    <img class="picture6" src="pictures/JavaScript To-do.png">
    <h1 class="javaScriptToDo">JavaScript To-Do List</h1>
    <p class="javaScriptToDoPara">In this project I made a fully functional To-do list that allows you to make a To-Do list you can add items, take items off or mark them as done, If you want to delete an item you simply click the "X" by the item you would like to take off. To mark an item as done you just click on the item you want to mark as done. It will change colors. I mainly used JavaScript to make this work and had to link all of the Elements in the HTML to the HTML. I used CSS to style the page and make it look better. This is my fifth project. </p>
    <img class="picture7" src="pictures/JavaScript Quiz Site.png">
    <h1 class="javaScriptQuiz">JavaScript Quiz Site</h1>
    <p class="javaScriptQuizPara">In this project I made a quiz site that has 3 questions to answer and it will give you results with after you click submit and it will reset when you click the reset button. It mainly used alot of JavaScript and very little HTML and used some CSS to style the poject. This was my sixth project</p>
